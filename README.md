The aim of the final evaluation is to apply some techniques of the course to the dataset 'TaiwanAirBox'.

This dataset represents the hourly level (in microgams per cubic meter) registered during March 2017 in several locations 

of Taiwan. One column represents one location but we do not have any information about the locations.

You will prepair the final evaluation for February 15th with an oral presentation (by group of two persons) explaining 

your analysis. Among possible analysis (without being exhaustive), one can:

1) Apply a prediction technique to the time series.

2) Make a descriptive analysis of the series, their stationarity or non-stationary properties, their autocorrelations and cross-correlations. 

3) Identifying some profiles (e.g. clusters explaining common profiles).

The presentation will last 20 minutes including questions.
